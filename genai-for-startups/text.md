AI adoption is rippling through the business landscape, but some businesses are more AI literate than others. Your level of AI literacy could be the difference between hypergrowth and obsolescence.  

But your business won't adopt AI effectively before you can speak it. And moreover, itâ€™s a full-time job to keep up with the exponentially growing AI developments. 

In "Generative AI for Businesses and Startups" you'll learn about the evergreen ideas in generative AI. You'll master the fundamentals of large language models, image models, prompt engineering, agents, and retrieval augmented generation. We'll explore how generative AI is helping businesses save and make money and what it will mean for businesses when generative AI turns AGI, becoming equally or more capable than humans at all tasks. 

"Generative AI for Businesses and Startups" guides you through the base concepts needed to fly with AI instead of dying because of it.

I'm excited to share my first self-published book, "Generative AI for Businesses and Startups". It's free for the next 3 days. 

It's a comprehensive guide the the fundementals of AI and how to use it for both big and small businesses, covering everything from LLMs and prompt engineering to privacy concerns and the future of AGI.

As a first-time author, a positive review would mean the world. 🙏

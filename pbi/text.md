Pedological Bias Inventory

Pedagogical Bias Inventory is a survey that a student takes periodically, throughout their educational tenure, to measure the amount of political bias is present in the child’s curriculum and teacher. Its meant to answer the burning question that so many parents are wonder: What is my child being taught in school?

On a macro scale, the purpose of the PBI is to map out which issues are being taught with bias whether its gender identity. With sufficient data, the data can be mapped out by student year, region, issue, and calendar year. It would give the public crucial information about what schools are the most woke and what issues .

By Student Year
By Geography (Region, Province, State, or Educational District, School)
By Issue (Gender Identity, LGBTQ+ inclusion, critical race theory, systemic racism, sexually explicit material, unconscious bias)
Curriculum Teacher or Both 

Using anonymized macro data from the PBI, we will be able to tell, for instance, which areas have the most bias education regarding a specific issue in a specific year in a specific region. [Give Example]

On a more personal level, the PBI is paid for by parents and administered by parents. Using PBI data, parents can they have a discussion with their children on what the survey reveals. 

Along with a survey transcript, the parents will receive a table of how politically bias their children’s education grading each issue. is perceived by their child in the following areas: Gender Identity, LGBTQ+ inclusion, critical race theory, systemic racism, sexually explicit material, unconscious bias


Importantly, survey questions would adapt to grade level of child, and with AI, the wording of each question would be able to adapt to the language level of the child. 

Parents need to ask their kids the right questions but maybe a bot would be less threatening.

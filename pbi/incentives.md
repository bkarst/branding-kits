# Getting a Child to Complete an Important Survey

There are several effective ways to encourage your child to complete an important survey:

## Set the context first
- Explain why the survey matters in age-appropriate terms
- Connect it to something they care about (their school, community, or interests)
- Set clear expectations about when and how long it will take

## Make it convenient
- Choose a time when they're not tired or hungry
- Ensure they have a comfortable space and working device
- Consider letting them use their preferred device (tablet vs. computer)

## Effective incentives
- Offer a small reward upon completion (extra screen time, a special treat, etc.)
- For older children, consider a small monetary reward for their time
- Plan a fun activity together afterward as both incentive and bonding time

## Additional strategies
- For younger children, offer to sit with them while they complete it
- For older children, respect their privacy but check in to see if they need help
- Break it into smaller sessions if it's lengthy
- Praise their effort and contribution when they finish

Most importantly, match your approach to your child's personality. Some respond well to rewards, while others are motivated by understanding why their participation matters.

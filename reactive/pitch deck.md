Problem Statement
Teachers are scarce in high demand subjects globally.

Clear articulation of the problem you're solving: 
The shortage of qualified English language teachers in Indonesia and Southeast Asia presents a significant challenge to the region's educational development. In Indonesia, despite the government's initiative to make English a mandatory subject by the 2027/2028 academic year, many teachers currently possess only basic to intermediate English proficiency. This gap hampers effective instruction and student comprehension.

Market pain points
English proficiency deeply impacts many sectors of the economy including tourism, international trade, and information technology. 

Indonesian hotels, tour companies, international schools, and local Indonesian schools are the most affected.

The mission of Essence AI to create tooling to easily create and refine and interact with persona-enabled agents (AIs with behavioral parameters, custom knowledge, and interactions). 

Essence AI v2 will add on several features including emotional expression generation from one picture, text to image, custom loras, voices, gamified relationship features, where the persona remembers past interactions and things you've said. 

Essence AI has trademarked the name 'Essence AI' (09 SaaS and 42) and holds a provisional patent to  extract personality/communication style from transcripts. You can upload a transcript, select a speaker and automatically create an interactive persona that remembers past interactions.
